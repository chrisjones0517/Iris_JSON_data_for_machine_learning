# Iris Training Data for Machine Learning Exercises
#####
I was going through tutorials on Tensorflow.js, when I realized that getting clean, simple data to experiment and learn with was hard to come by. One of the tutorials I was following used the traditional 'Iris' data. I was only able to find CSV and poorly named JSON for this task. I used a sandbox in Node.js to refine the data to its present form.
